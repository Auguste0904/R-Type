1.  Introduction

    This request for Comments (RFC) provides 
    information about our R-Type project developed
    as part of our schooling at Epitech. 

    The objective of this project is to create an 
    R-Type conforming to the original born in 1987
    on an arcade terminal. It is a series of 
    two-dimentional video games emblematic of the 
    horizontal scrolling shoot them up, developed by
    Irem.

    This video game is coded in C++ whith the sfml
    as graphics library.
